# Mob spawning is configured via mob groups, see http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Spawn#Mob_spawning

# A mobgroups is made of four parts; mob name, weight, min and max.
# - Mob name is one of the Minecraft internal mob names. See http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chunk_format#Mobs
# - Weight is used for a random selection. Must be a positive number.
# - Min is the minimum amount of mobs spawning as a group. Must be a positive number.
# - Max is the maximum amount of mobs spawning as a group. Must be a positive number.

# Mob groups are written to the config files as Json.
# Json is a tree document format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
# Syntax: {"mob": "mobname", "weight": integer, "min": integer, "max": integer}
# Example: {"mob": "minecraft:ocelot", "weight": 10, "min": 2, "max": 6}
# Example: {"mob": "minecraft:mooshroom", "weight": 5, "min": 2, "max": 2}
# A json list of mobgroups looks like this: [ mobgroup, mobgroup, mobgroup... ]
# This would be an ampty list: []
# You can validate your json here: http://jsonlint.com/

# There are six categories of mobs: monsters, creatures, water creatures, ambient creatures, water ambient creatures and miscellaneous.
# You can add your own mobs to the mobgroups below, mobs may only work when used in specific categories, depending on their type.
# To see the mob category a mob belongs to, use /otg entities. The mob's category (if any) is listed after its name.
# Also supports modded mobs, if they are of the correct mob category.
# The monsters (blazes, cave spiders, creepers, drowned, elder guardians, ender dragons, endermen, endermites, evokers, ghasts, giants,
# guardians, hoglins, husks, illusioners, magma cubes, phantoms, piglins, pillagers, ravagers, shulkers, silverfishes, skeletons, slimes,
# spiders, strays, vexes, vindicators, witches, zoglins, zombies, zombie villagers, zombified piglins) that spawn in this biome.
# For instance [{"mob": "minecraft:spider", "weight": 100, "min": 4, "max": 4}, {"mob": "minecraft:zombie", "weight": 100, "min": 4, "max": 4}]
# Use the "/otg entities" console command to get a list of possible mobs and mob categories.
# Use the "/otg biome -m" console command to get the list of registered mobs for a biome.
